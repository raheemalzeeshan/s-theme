# Shopify Skeleton Theme
The "Shopify Skeleton Theme" refers to a bare-bones, minimalistic starting point or template for building a custom Shopify theme. It provides a basic structure and essential files that can be used as a foundation to develop a fully customized theme.

The purpose of the Shopify Skeleton Theme is to provide developers with a clean and organized starting point for building a custom Shopify theme. By starting with a minimalistic structure, developers have the freedom to design and implement unique layouts, styles, and functionality tailored to their clients' needs without being constrained by pre-existing design choices.

It's worth noting that the Shopify Skeleton Theme is not an official Shopify theme provided by Shopify itself. Instead, it is often a community-driven project or a starting point created by developers and shared on platforms like GitHub. These themes can serve as a solid foundation for building highly customized and unique Shopify themes.
